She's like a possum - the disease she carries doesn't affect her, but instead slowly affects everything around her
</p>
<p>
She appears in sullen places. Old games, the half-furnished bedrooms of childhood homes, movies left to slowly corrupt on an old VHS tape.
</p>
<p>
Everything rots around her, the insides slowly corrupting, viscous and red, bleeding and pale, becoming unrecognizable while chunks of wall fall off in gross, chewy slabs.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully this disease does not affect the living, only the things you used to love.
